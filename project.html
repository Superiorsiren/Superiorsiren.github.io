        <h1>Research & Development</h1>
        <h2>User Surveys</h2>
        <p>Tools: Google Forms, Google Sheets</p>
        <p>The first destination in the journey was to conduct user surveys to discover what the people wanted from their cloud storage platform. This included a variety of questions geared towards finding how users currently feel about the current cloud storage options, as well as some questions about a creative platform to narrow down user needs.</p>
        <h5>View User Survey Results</h5>
        <ul>
          <li class="label">A Few Questions</li>
          <li>When thinking about the specific cloud storage platforms you have used, what is most frustrating?</li>
          <li>Which features do you use most?</li>
          <li>What would be your reason(s) for using a Creative Cloud Based Storage Platform?</li>
          <li>Would you be willing to share your projects with others?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="label">The Results</li>
          <li>Focusing on the features used most, file sharing, file organization, and project collaboration were marked highest.</li>
          <li>Similarly, when asked what features users would want in a creative cloud storage platform, collaboration and file organization led the way.</li>
          <li>Users also mentioned wanting more free storage, less ads, and a simpler way to organize files.</li>
          <li>More than a third of those surveyed reported seamless synchronization between multiple devices as a favorite feature.</li>
          <li>There was also a wide range of age groups represented. This helped to clarify the scope of the target audience.</li>
          <li>Diving deeper into collaboration features, direct messaging and message boards were ranked the highest for mode of collaboration.</li>
          <li>Of those interested in the creative cloud-based platform, 100% were willing to share their projects with others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>Tools: Figma</p>
        <p>Based on the survey results, three user personas were designed with a broad range of experience and needs to set the scope for the target audience.</p>
        <div class="lexi">
          <h4>Lexi, Home DIY on a Dime</h4>
          <p>Bio</p>
          <p>Lexi Williams, age 24, works as a junior accountant in Syracuse, NY. Lexi recently got married and bought a house that requires some TLC. She loves doing projects and learning new skills.</p>
          <p>Motivations</p>
          <p>She would really like to find a site with helpful tutorials to complete her projects and stay organized.</p>
          <p>Frustrations</p>
          <p>Too many ads and unhelpful links on Pinterest have discouraged her from using that platform anymore. Dislikes having to use separate platforms to have To-Do lists, budget spreadsheets, and tutorials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mary">
          <h4>Mary, Mother of Photos</h4>

          <p>Motivations</p>
          <p>Mary needs a space that is secure and allows her to make some photos private, but allows her to share others with friends and family.</p>
          <p>Frustrations</p>
          <p>Doesn’t feel Google Drive is supporting her needs for division of work and personal items. Wants better visualization of sets of photos and would like to leave notes with photo sets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="maggie">
          <h4>Maggie, Fairy-grandmother of the Green Gardens</h4>

      <section class="competative">
        <h2>Competative Analysis</h2>
        <p>Following the path laid by the user data, a competitive analysis was completed on Pinterest, Dropbox, and Youtube. Each platform organizes different types of media, yet allows collaboration between users. Three features stood out in particular.</p>
        <div class="pinterest">
          <h4>Pinterest</h4>
          <p>Visual and text design language</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dropbox">
          <h4>Dropbox</h4>
          <p>Flexible paper feature</p>
        </div>
        <div class="youtube">
          <h4>Youtube</h4>
          <p>Inclusive communication via videos</p>
        </div>
        <p>The comparison also directly supported the data collected from the surveys. Users are tired of ads and complicated file organization. The positive comments mentioned features such as free to start, consistent transition to and from mobile to desktop, and easy to organize and search items.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="summary">Takeaways</li>
          <li>Project Share</li>
          <li>No ads and more storage</li>

      <section class="stories">
        <h1>Info Architecture</h1>
        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>Tools: Google Sheets</p>
        <p>Using the collected data, the next step was to build out user stories. Applying the client’s original feature requirements the high priority category was set. The user survey results also offered insight into the most important features to the users, adding medium and low priority stories.  Tying all those together, the user experience was simplified with user personas in mind.</p>

      <section class="flows">
        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>Tools: Pencil and paper, Draw.io</p>
        <p>Up next, user flows were sketched and then translated into draw.io to ensure the user experience was smooth and simple. Each high priority user story was mapped out with the user personas in mind. At the end of the process, each user persona need met by the feature was identified to discourage scope creep.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="needs">High Priority Stories</li>
          <li>Customizable</li>

      </section>
      <section class="wireframes">
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Tools: Pencil and paper, Figma</p>
        <p>Moving on to building the skeleton of the design, wireframes were sketched from each user flow and then mocked in Figma to produce a clickable prototype for user testing.</p>
        <p>During this process, it also became clear that there were some limitations to the collaboration features. Originally, the design was to include direct messaging and forums in a huge feature called Guilds. It would allow users to join groups of like-minded people and share ideas. This however was not to be. As a designer, I had to consider time/budget constraints for the project. While it was disappointing, I had to push some features to the “later” user story pile.</p>

      <section class="testingone">
        <h2>Usability Testing Round One</h2>
        <p>Tools: InVision, Pencil and paper, Zoom</p>
        <p>Usability testing was conducted next to check on the functionality of the design thus far. Four users of varying technical skill levels and age groups were asked to do four tasks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sign up for an account</li>
          <li>Add a project folder</li>
          <li>Add a photo to the project folder</li>
          <li>Navigate to The Hall via the menu</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>View First Prototype</h4>
        <h2>The Results</h2>
          <p>Users had difficulty finding the sign up link from the sign in page. To fix this, the clutter of options was reduced and the text size increased to make the link more visible.</p>
          <p>They also struggled to navigate from photo view to The Hall. Instead of making the user click back and then menu, the menu was made available from all storage layers. Some changes based on suggestions from the Lead Designer to standardize button sizing and spacing were also made during this phase.</p>
          <p>Finally, they had difficulty adding a photo to a project folder. As a result, the size of the add button was increased.</p>
        <p>Testing revealed some gaps in navigation, which I had been unable to forsee on my own. Rolling together all the information collected thus far, three goals were set to move the design forward. Be inclusive, simple, and playful.</p>

        <h1>Visual Design</h1>
        <h2>The Branding Journey</h2>
        <p>Tools: Pencil and paper, Sketch, Figma</p>
        <h5>View Style Guide</h5>
        <p>Taking a look at my logo, I chose to use the Knights of the Round Table as a lead. When thinking about a collaboration of minds where plans are stored, medieval war counsels came to mind. Where the map is laid out and the pieces are shuffled around according to the plan. There may be some scrolls of communication also on the table. All the generals would gather around the table, each bringing their own plans of action to contribute. It would be a meeting of the minds that draws out creative planning. This image was used as a foundation and then simplified and organized. </p>
        <p>The color choices stemmed from that original image. Looking at time, creativity can spark at any time, day, night, or in the minutes between. Dusk has the lore of being a time of magic and invokes feelings of peace. Sunsets have been the focus of many works of art. Using a photo of a line of sun as it disappears below the horizon, two primary colors were chosen from the sky. A few secondary lighter shades were added to give the design some depth and to help users differentiate different layers of organization within the interface.</p>
        <p>The typeface went through a few changes during branding. Originally fun, whimsical font ideas playing close to the medieval theme were chosen. However, they didn’t blend well with the logo and the design goals. In the end, a clean, rounded font was selected to compliment the feel of the design.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="mockups">
        <h2>High Fidelity Mockups</h2>
        <p>Tools: Figma</p>
        <p>After branding, preference testing was conducted to determine if the buttons and menu layouts were on track. Once the results were in, all the new changes were applied during the transition to  Hi-fi mockups.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="testingtwo">
        <h2>Usability Testing Round Two</h2>
        <p>Tools: InVision, Pencil and paper, Zoom</p>
        <p>After the transformation to high-fidelity, usability testing was conducted for a second time. Taking advantage of this opportunity to test the desktop version, the user experience could be compared to the first round of testing with the mobile mockups. This confirmed the transition between devices was consistent.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sign in to an account</li>
          <li>Add a project folder</li>
          <li>Add a photo to the project folder</li>
          <li>Copy Notebook A to another folder</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>View Second Prototype</h5>
        <h2>The Results</h2>
          <p>Enlisting the same testers from the first round gave a snapshot of how the changes improved or altered their experience. All users had a much easier time navigating through the tasks in the second round.</p>
          <p>The CTA button on the landing page was below the scroll line. Changing the font sizes of the logo title and subheading while shifting the text up brought the CTA button up to the center of the viewport.</p>
          <p>A tester tried to add a project folder by clicking the … options asset on the existing folders. The same thing happened in testing in the first round. I considered adding an “add…” option to the dropdown. However, I chose to stick with the orange add icon as it is the common way users would look to do that task.</p>
          <p>Another tester struggled with the final task of copying “Notebook A” to another project folder. Once she found the options dropdown menu, she chose “copy link” instead of “copy to…”. She stated she was looking for something visual like a file…copy. Possible to add a collapsible toolbar under the header would have worked better. This was saved for a later feature. The solution put into effect was to move the copy to… under the copy link in the options dropdown menu in order to make it easier to differentiate between the two quickly. Feedback was also received from the lead designer to streamline the header color and remove some of the rounded corners from the design.</p>
        <p>Looking at the tester experiences, the improvements in navigation from wireframe testing to this second iteration satisfied the high-priority user stories for the design. Taking all the testing feedback and some last minute alterations to the visual design, the final design deliverables were completed.</p>

      <section class="final">
        <h1>Final Deliverables</h1>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <h3>Design a cloud storage solution that would be successful in the expanding market. </h3>
        <h5>View Final Prototype</h5>
        <p>Users are tired of complicated features, excessive ads, and not enough storage support. They are also looking for collaboration options and a simple organization process to support their project needs.</p>
        <p>We offer flexible data storage solutions to meet a variety of user needs, eliminating ad cluttered UI and allowing the user to feel more in control of their experience. We round it out with real-time collaboration and project share to connect users to real people. Whether you are a professional photographer looking for a way to store your photos or a seasoned knitter looking to share your skills with other people, there will be a place for you on Round Table.</p>
        <p>Though the final product wasn’t the grandiose design I had originally hoped for, I do think the project utilized user data to satisfy the user story needs and delivered a design to the client that was made for the creative user. A design to make their life a little easier and bring a smile to their face. Rescuing them from ruin, one project at a time.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="conclusion">
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>To wrap it up, this project taught me a lot about how progress is more important than perfection. Deadlines are extremely important. As are tried and true processes. I was so worried about my design being too mainstream that I forgot users need something familiar or they will quickly move on to an easier option. I still like the flow and feel of my design, but I could have made better use of existing tools. With more time, I would want to add direct messages for collaboration and more organization tools. But, like any good adventurer knows, it isn’t about the destination, it’s about the journey. What is most important is that I learned. Progress over perfection. Start with the fundamentals. Best practice and then add a pinch of unique.</p>
