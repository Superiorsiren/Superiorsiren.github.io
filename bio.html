                     <p>Here’s the thing. I suck at biographies. My path to design was more of a journey than a moment. There was no big thing that led me here, only a collection of tiny moments. I originally had a 17 page synopsis of my life, but time is precious so let me see if I can summarize it for you.</p>

                     <p>“My Mom was 17 when she had me.” is something I’ve repeated in job interviews many times over. It is sort of odd, right? What does that really say about me? The thing is, it directly affected every decision I’ve made and continues to do so, though in a different way. I spent the beginning of my childhood with my Grandmother. My Grandmother had epilepsy. This meant I had to be a caretaker from an early age, so I didn’t play like normal kids. Instead, I was taught to cook, garden, and sew. These were my first tastes of creative thinking. I began to train my eye for color, textures, and pattern matching. I found joy in creating, whatever it was. Living with my Grandmother also set me up to live a life intensely aware of others and their emotional state.</p>

                  <div class="bio-column5">
                     <p>Let’s fast forward to high school graduation. I come from a small, midwest town. Art wasn’t considered much of a career option. My family convinced me to get a degree in the medical field, so that’s what I did. And I hated it. But, I’m not the type to give up. I spent my 20’s bouncing between patient care and customer service, trying my best to be satisfied with helping people. In the back of my mind, I knew my destiny lay elsewhere. Thankfully, I met a lot of wonderful teachers along the way which fostered my strengths in cognitive empathy and communication.</p>

                  <div class="bio-column5">
                     <p>My first creative breakthrough came while planning my honeymoon. It just so happened that an anime convention in Columbus, Ohio would take place the week after our wedding. This sparked a flame in me that had been out for a long time. I had an insane urge to create a costume 2 weeks prior to my wedding. And so began my cosplay journey. It was such a rush! I was creating again and I had never been so challenged. Forget diamonds, Mommy wants 5 yards of Yaya Han’s 4-way stretch. The beauty of cosplay is freedom. Here is a problem, solve it in any way possible. It’s all an interpretation. I was able to flex my problem solving skills in a new, creative way, adding to my arsenal of tools.</p>

                  <div class="bio-column5">
                     <p>After building my confidence in the service industry for 13 years, I felt my next challenge lay in starting my own sewing business. I had discovered a love for cosplay and it was my saving grace during the gray years. If wearing my passions had got me through the tough times, then I would do the same for others. My passion is passion. I believe in its ability to lift the spirit. This adventure was my first taste of making things for other people and it was eye-opening. I learned to use my empathetic nature to give customers a unique experience that would celebrate who they were, while also conditioning myself to creative criticism. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to provide for my family.</p>

                     <p>Enter Thinkful’s Design Program. I always thought my ability to be both creative and organized was a curse. Design. It was there all along. Creating pushes me to be my best self and fills me with a sense of duty to pave the path for those like me. The lost ones. I can use cognitive empathy to design things that make life easier for users. How can you find a balance between efficient user experience and engaging visual design? That’s why I am here. I’ve always loved hero stories, but it is time I write my own. My name is Ashley Marie Ross and I am the UX Hero. Think I can’t save people from the inconveniences of the world? Watch me.</p>
