                  <p>Similarly, when asked what features users would want in a creative cloud storage platform, collaboration and file organization led the way.</p>
                  <p>Users also mentioned wanting more free storage, less ads, and a simpler way to organize files.</p>
                  <p>More than a third of those surveyed reported seamless synchronization between multiple devices as a favorite feature.</p>
                  <p>There was also a wide range of age groups represented. This helped to clarify the scope of the target audience.</p>
                  <p>Diving deeper into collaboration features, direct messaging and message boards were ranked the highest for mode of collaboration.</p>
                  <p>Of those interested in the creative cloud-based platform, 100% were willing to share their projects with others.</p>

               <p>During this process, it also became clear that there were some limitations to the collaboration features. Originally, the design was to include direct messaging and forums in a huge feature called Guilds. It would allow users to join groups of like-minded people and share ideas. This however was not to be. As a designer, I had to consider time/budget constraints for the project. While it was disappointing, I had to push some features to the “later” user story pile.</p>

                  <p>Taking a look at my logo, I chose to use the Knights of the Round Table as a lead. When thinking about a collaboration of minds where plans are stored, medieval war counsels came to mind. Where the map is laid out and the pieces are shuffled around according to the plan. There may be some scrolls of communication also on the table. All the generals would gather around the table, each bringing their own plans of action to contribute. It would be a meeting of the minds that draws out creative planning. This image was used as a foundation and then simplified and organized. </p>

                  <p>The color choices stemmed from that original image. Looking at time, creativity can spark at any time, day, night, or in the minutes between. Dusk has the lore of being a time of magic and invokes feelings of peace. Sunsets have been the focus of many works of art. Using a photo of a line of sun as it disappears below the horizon, two primary colors were chosen from the sky. A few secondary lighter shades were added to give the design some depth and to help users differentiate different layers of organization within the interface.</p>

                     <p>Another tester struggled with the final task of copying “Notebook A” to another project folder. Once she found the options dropdown menu, she chose “copy link” instead of “copy to…”. She stated she was looking for something visual like a file…copy. Possible to add a collapsible toolbar under the header would have worked better. This was saved for a later feature. The solution put into effect was to move the copy to… under the copy link in the options dropdown menu in order to make it easier to differentiate between the two quickly. Feedback was also received from the lead designer to streamline the header color and remove some of the rounded corners from the design.</p>

               <p>To wrap it up, this project taught me a lot about how progress is more important than perfection. Deadlines are extremely important. As are tried and true processes. I was so worried about my design being too mainstream that I forgot users need something familiar or they will quickly move on to an easier option. I still like the flow and feel of my design, but I could have made better use of existing tools. With more time, I would want to add direct messages for collaboration and more organization tools. But, like any good adventurer knows, it isn’t about the destination, it’s about the journey. What is most important is that I learned. Progress over perfection. Start with the fundamentals. Best practice and then add a pinch of unique.</p>
